# Bâtisso API

Backend for Bâtisso, a savings-for-construction platform for hardware stores:
customers save step by step at their store, follow their construction goals, and
buy materials with every movement recorded in a trustworthy register.

Built with NestJS 12, PostgreSQL 17 (Docker), Prisma 7, and Swagger.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- Docker Desktop (PostgreSQL runs in Docker Compose)

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # local defaults work as-is
npm run db:up               # PostgreSQL on localhost:5433 (dev + test databases)
npm run prisma:generate     # generates the Prisma client into src/generated/
npm run start:dev           # http://localhost:3000
```

Check it works:

- Health: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health returns `{"status":"ok","database":"up",...}`
- API docs (French): http://localhost:3000/docs

## Common commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run start:dev` | Start the API in watch mode |
| `npm run db:up` / `npm run db:down` | Start / stop PostgreSQL (data is kept in the `pgdata` volume) |
| `npm run prisma:migrate` | Create and apply a migration after a schema change |
| `npm run prisma:studio` | Browse the database |
| `npm test` | Unit tests |
| `npm run test:e2e` | End-to-end tests against the `batisso_test` database (needs `db:up`) |
| `npm run build` | Compile to `dist/` |
| `npm run lint` / `npm run format` | Lint / format the code |

## Conventions

- All routes live under `/api/v1`.
- Every error response has the same shape:
  `{ statusCode, error, message, details?, path, timestamp }`. `message` is in
  French and safe to show to users; `error` is a stable code for client apps.
- Swagger descriptions and API messages are in French; code is in English.

## Environment variables

| Name | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | | `postgresql://` URL |
| `PORT` | no | `3000` | |
| `NODE_ENV` | no | `development` | `development`, `test`, or `production` (Swagger is off in production) |

The app refuses to start if a variable is missing or invalid.
